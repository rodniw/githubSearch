I need to change a lot after the 10th commit. 

TODO:
1) Start using dagger 2.11 and higher.
2) Start using RxJava
3) Let's work more with the ui state.
4) Create Repository and start using Clean Architecture.
5) Use some cache(for example Room).

I will get rid of the lines which im gonna complete.
